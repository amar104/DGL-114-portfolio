## Best interface mobile app(Amazon) ## 
<p> I think Amazon is of the best shopping app that i love to use because it is easy to operate and it is very user friendly.Secondly,once we stored our personal information like our address and card details then we can easily buy anything without wasting time.Besides that, it affers things for everyone and all the information is placed conveninently so it is easy to navigate.Apart from that, various kinds of filters and product lists are available which helps users for finding their required product in fraction of seconds. </p>
<h2> Poor interface mobile app(Weatherbug)</h2>
<p> The Weatherbug mobile app is one of the weather app that i consider it has bad user interface beacuse its main screen is cover with full of ads that looks too ugly and busy.Secondly ,some advertisements put negative effect on users mind because they show inapproprieate content.And most of user prefer something simple and clean,clear that fulfill their needs and purpose by installing it,i personally used this app and after two days i uninstalled it.
